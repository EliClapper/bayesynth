  abstract = {The last 25 years have shown a steady increase in attention for the Bayes factor as a tool for hypothesis evaluation and model selection. The present review highlights the potential of the Bayes factor in psychological research. We discuss six types of applications: Bayesian evaluation of point null, interval, and informative hypotheses, Bayesian evidence synthesis, Bayesian variable selection and model averaging, and Bayesian evaluation of cognitive models. We elaborate what each application entails, give illustrative examples, and provide an overview of key references and software with links to other applications. The paper is concluded with a discussion of the opportunities and pitfalls of Bayes factor applications and a sketch of corresponding future research lines.},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis in the presence of unexplained heterogeneity is frequently undertaken by using a random-effects model, in which the effects underlying different studies are assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution. Here we discuss the justification and interpretation of such models, by addressing in turn the aims of estimation, prediction and hypothesis testing. A particular issue that we consider is the distinction between inference on the mean of the random-effects distribution and inference on the whole distribution. We suggest that random-effects meta-analyses as currently conducted often fail to provide the key results, and we investigate the extent to which distribution-free, classical and Bayesian approaches can provide satisfactory methods. We conclude that the Bayesian approach has the advantage of naturally allowing for full uncertainty, especially for prediction. However, it is not without problems, including computational intensity and sensitivity to a priori judgements. We propose a simple prediction interval for classical meta-analysis and offer extensions to standard practice of Bayesian meta-analysis, making use of an example of studies of `set shifting' ability in people with eating disorders.},

  abstract = {While it is widely acknowledged that psychology is in the throes of a replication `crisis', relatively little attention has been paid to the role theory plays in our evaluation of replications as `failed' or `successful'. This paper applies well-known arguments in philosophy of science about the interplay between theory and experiment to a contemporary case study of infants' understanding of false belief (Onishi and Baillargeon [2005]), and attempts to replicate it. It argues that the lack of consensus about over-arching theories informing both the concepts under study and the methodologies used to track them means that researchers disagree over which experiments constitute replications of the original. The second part of the paper places this specific debate within a broader discussion of the replication crisis as a crisis of `theory', developing work by Muthukrishna and Henrich ([2018]) and Bird ([2018]). Bird argues that the lack of agreed over-arching theories in psychology means that a high rate of replication failure is to be expected; this paper agrees with his diagnosis but challenges his proposal that more replication will resolve the problem.},

  abstract = {Adolescence is a developmentally sensitive period for emotion regulation with potentially lifelong implications for mental health and well-being. Although substantial empirical research has addressed this topic, the literature is fragmented across subdisciplines, and an overarching theoretical framework is lacking. The first step toward constructing a unifying framework is identifying relevant phenomena. This systematic review of 6305 articles used text mining to identify phenomena relevant to adolescents' emotion regulation. First, a baseline was established of relevant phenomena discussed in theory and recent narrative reviews. Then, article keywords and abstracts were analyzed using text mining, examining term frequency as an indicator of relevance and term co-occurrence as an indicator of association. The results reflected themes commonly featured in theory and narrative reviews, such as socialization and neurocognitive development, but also identified undertheorized themes, such as developmental disorders, physical health, external stressors, structural disadvantage, substance use, identity and moral development, and sexual development. The findings illustrate how text mining systematic reviews, a novel approach, may complement narrative reviews. Future theoretical work might integrate these undertheorized themes into an overarching framework, and empirical research might consider them as promising areas for future research, or as potential confounders in research on adolescents' emotion regulation.},

  abstract = {When analyzing a heterogeneous body of literature, there may be many  potentially relevant between-studies differences. These differences can be  coded as moderators, and accounted for using meta-regression. However, many  applied meta-analyses lack the power to adequately account for multiple  moderators, as the number of studies on any given topic is often low. The  present study introduces Bayesian Regularized Meta-Analysis (BRMA), an  exploratory algorithm that can select relevant moderators from a larger number  of candidates. This approach is suitable when heterogeneity is suspected, but  it is not known which moderators most strongly influence the observed effect  size. We present a simulation study to validate the performance of BRMA  relative to state-of-the-art meta-regression (RMA). Results indicated that  BRMA compared favorably to RMA on three metrics: predictive performance,  which is a measure of the generalizability of results, the ability to reject  irrelevant moderators, and the ability to recover population parameters with  low bias. BRMA had slightly lower ability to detect true effects of relevant  moderators, but the overall proportion of Type I and Type II errors was  equivalent to RMA. Furthermore, BRMA regression coefficients were slightly  biased towards zero (by design), but its estimates of residual heterogeneity  were unbiased. BRMA performed well with as few as 20 studies in the training  data, suggesting its suitability as a small sample solution. We discuss how  applied researchers can use BRMA to explorate between-studies heterogeneity  in meta-analysis.},
